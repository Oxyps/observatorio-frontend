# Observatório 👁‍🗨🎲

## Description 📜
This project is an implementation of my undergraduate thesis.
Which consists in visualize a large number of data in an easier way, through charts.

## Open Data 🔓
The data analysed comes from a huge CSV file provided by [Brazilian Open Data Portal](http://www.dados.gov.br). This data went through an ETL proccess, by [Leonardo Gabriel Lubczyk](https://github.com/kyrosx/observatorio_etl), to be structured in the database.

## API 💾
An API was created to serve the backend. This project consumes [observatorio-backend](https://github.com/oxyps/observatorio-backend) and gives it a face.
